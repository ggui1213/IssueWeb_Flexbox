    <p>Time and again, we are heartbroken by the news of another mass shooting. Part of our healing must be the conviction that we will do everything in our power to keep these tragedies from happening in a nation that continues to face a pandemic of gun violence. </p>
    <p>It's not only the high-profile mass shootings that we must work to prevent, but also the daily death-by-guns that claims more than 30,000 lives every year. </p>
    <p>We believe that there are ways to stop these unfortunate tragedy, and one of the most important is to stand out and call out our concerns towards those violences by our own vioces. We trust whoever seem this text would realize and try to take a further step to peaceful future</p></div>
